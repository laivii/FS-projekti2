### Why and how it works?

This is a projec for our Full Stack course.

The assigment was to learn, work with and make an API for an web application.

The application should be able to do the following:
* Take inputs for your comment: username, country and message
* Take input for a search
* Post and delete full comments
* Update message in a comment and save the update
  * There should be an indicator beside the time stamp that a comment has been updated
* Search a comment by name
  * The output only comes to your console at this time (30.04.2023)
